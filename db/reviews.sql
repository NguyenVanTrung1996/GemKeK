A 2D ball voyages to the other side of the map, grabs the flag, and brings it back. However, it has been implemented in such a way that creates vast strategy, often forcing split-second decisions that can dramatically alter the outcome of the match. These strategies come to fruition in three main ways: human enemies, human teammates, and the physics.
When trying to bring the flag back, one must beat the enemies in a race of sorts to their own base. This can be done by taking the optimum paths, tricking the opponents, or by simply outmaneuvering them. It requires an extreme amount of situational awareness that can only be developed over time.
Being good on your own is great, but your teammates can either carry you to victory or cause your defeat. Teamwork is vital, and this is done by protecting the flag carrier or protecting your own flag. It is also very important to have a full team, as each new player greatly increases the chance of victory. But with a lot of ways to kill your own teammates (added fun), be careful not to let the other team have an advantage. There isn''t that much of this, or of rage quitting.
The physics are why most people play, I believe. Apart from the basics, there are countless nuances that take weeks to even realize and months to get the hang of.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic setting, the intro tells of a group of people been assigned for preservation of the human race from a catastrophic featuring an asteroid wiping out civilisation. Staring as one of people being preserved, you are woken up from your cryostasis in a preservation pod, finding out that you''re the only one alive, once leaving the pod you find yourself in a desolate world surrounded by mutant, bandits and a group called the Authority. 

The story is non-existent including your character''s personality, back history, or even an authority and reason for yourself. The character being played is nothing more than a blank slate, ID Software (though never really praised for its story) failed horribly on this aspect of the game, most of the time, nothing was interesting about what you were doing or why you were doing it, every time you go out to fight, the sense of achievement is seldom. Even though ID Software tries to create some dynamic characters to interact with, all of them seem to have this inauthentic feel to their personality, though their designs of the character and clothing fit the bill of someone who has a certain type of personality, the dialogue and the voice acting is forced. When interacting with characters in a main mission, the game forces you to be with them at all time when giving their briefing, listening to what they''re saying, there''s no skipping these moments nor is there anything interesting for them to say.Some quests and mission such as racing are also required to get through the game. ID Software could have done better. 
But looking at some positives, RAGE''s gunplay makes the game very enjoyable to play. Featuring the generic pistol, shotgun, sub machine gun and a few apocalyptic weapon. Each weapon packs it own punch, the fights and the AI interaction with the enemies you face can be a fantastic experience, each enemy has their own intelligence when fighting.

insert into reviews (id, content, title, rating, user_id, game_id, created_at, updated_at) values (335, 'Let me get this straight, right from the first paragraph – Blade Of Darkness isn''t a walk in the park. It''s challenging and fairly unforgiving, brutally punishing those who rush happily at their first enemy with a sword in their hand by chopping their head off. Severance requires quite a bit of discipline, caution and patience – but if you possess all that, it''s going to be one of the most rewarding and fun games you''ve ever played.

If I had to summarize this game with just one word, it would have to be ''combat''. BOD puts combat above everything else, combat is its heart and core. The combat mechanics were fairly revolutionary at the time of its release; while the fighting system of most other hack-n-slash games of that time (Enclave, Rune...) consisted of the player''s character jumping around and click-spamming the enemies, combat in Blade Of Darkness instead resembles a fighting game like, say, Mortal Kombat – although not as hectic and far more strategic. "A fighting game in third-person view" would be a fairly fitting description; while the camera is kept behind the character''s back at all times, the combat consists of blocking, attacking and performing keyboard combos – and keeping an eye on the character''s stamina and everything else going on around you, because the other enemies won''t hesitate to attack you while you''re busy trying not to get killed by that one troll with a poisoned sword in front of you. Every fight is truly an adrenaline rush – no matter how confident you are, the harsh reality is that the ork around the next corner can chop you to pieces just as easily as that fearsome minotaur that you''ve just defeated.

To make things better (or, perhaps, worse, depending on how you look at it), the movement and combat feels heavy and slow-ish, making it impossible to just jump and click your way out of every situation. The characters can indeed dodge and jump out of the way of the enemy''s blade if you''re quick enough to react, but if you hope that you can pull that off in a small room with a few enemies, you''re in for a rude awakening. Every blow and every slash of the sword feels heavy, no matter if it''s your club hitting an enemy knight or his sword cutting through your flesh. It''s outright impossible to simply click your foes to death. Like it or not, you''ll have to learn to fight efficiently and skillfully.

But once you master this skill, every fight becomes a beautiful dance rather than a challenge. The succession of dodges, quick stabs, blocks and well-timed combos is an entrancing and captivating sight, something that turns the fight into a product of intuition rather than precise calculation. Has the enemy started doing that particular attack that exposes his side? Go for a quick swing from the left. Or raise your weapon for a second, blocking his move, and counter-attack with a fierce diagonal cut. Rebel Act did an amazing job, making the gameplay fluid and intuitive, hard enough to keep your teeth clenched but incredibly rewarding when it all pays off at the end and you successfully chop the head off that ork and watch it fly across the room with spurts of blood painting the walls red.

Speaking of that, the game is notoriously violent and outright gory – something that only adds to the satisfaction after defeating a difficult enemy. Heads, limbs and pieces of torsos are all perfectly detachable when it comes to sharp weapons applied to them, with obligatory blood pools completing the picture – and the playable characters aren''t safe from having their limbs chopped off, too. Furthermore, the hacked off gibs can be picked up and carried around and even used as weapons in their own right – not particularly efficient weapons, sure, but definitely intimidating ones. The same applies to just about any other object of right size in the game – anything from bones to stools can be picked up and used to hit enemies with.

But it would be a lie to say that all that this game has to offer is combat. Oftentimes, you''ll find yourself running around temples and tombs, palaces and ancient ruins trying to solve a mystery or (most often) open a particular gate or door to advance through the level. A game with a brilliant combat system but terrible location design would be a huge disappointment – thankfully, Severance isn''t one. Whether it''s a foggy circular fortress or a creepy island of the dead, ruins of an ancient city in the middle of the rainforest or a sand-swept temple in the desert, all the locations are absolutely beautiful and atmospheric – and, let''s admit it, that is quite a compliment for a game released in 2001. Some of the architecture and sceneries are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, making you stop all the running and fighting for a minute just to admire the view. Drawing influence from various cultures around the world (mainly those located in the Fertile Crescent, but reaching as far as India and even South America for one location), the level design has amazing style to it, fully immersing the player into the world of the game. At the same time, with all their richness and beauty, the locations never feel safe. Both the dark and gloomy levels and the bright and sun-caressed ones have that feeling of disturbance to them, making you look behind your back every now and then and expect a foe to jump at you from any recess in the wall. Occasionally, Blade Of Darkness takes a nosedive straight into the horror genre, making you visit dark creepy dungeons and towers of necromancers – and even a pitch-black crypt once, where you have to fight through hordes of mummified zombies in the flickering light of your torch that has an annoying tendency of burning out.

Speaking of torches and pitch-black crypts, Blade Of Darkness loves playing with light and shadows. It was one of the first games – if not the first one – that featured real-time volumetric shadows, and, as if that was not enough, shadows from several sources of light at once – which is truly an impressive feature for a game from 2001. The graphics of Severance were fantastic at the time of its release – for 2001, it was essentially what Crysis was for 2007, a benchmark and a new standard for videogame graphics. In addition to the games of shadows mentioned above, the graphics quality plays a defining role in the beauty of architecture and landscapes described in the previous paragraph. When you see a sacred temple of a deity, sculpted with meticulous attention to detail, or a cold fortress of the knights atop the mountain, with patches of snow covering passageways between its high stone walls, it is sometimes hard to believe that something this beautiful and detailed was made in 2001. In this regard, the game has aged astonishingly well, enemy models being just about the only thing that immediately doesn''t look modern at first glance.

Music is something else that adds to the atmosphere greatly. It suits the events of the game perfectly; it''s rich and beautiful when you''re exploring deserted areas and taking in the magnificent views, it''s tense and exciting when you''re battling a difficult enemy, it''s epic and solemn during some of the game''s most climactic scenes and fights. It can be chilling and creepy in dark dungeons, but then it will smoothly change to a lighter ambient score once you make it to an outdoor area. Overall, sans some somewhat cheesy suspense effects, the sound design of Severance is brilliant – it''s definitely a shame that the game''s score was never released separately. While all the sounds and music of BOD are easily accessible in the game''s folder, the audio quality is quite mediocre, some of the music pieces being mono wavs sampled at 22 kHz, others – 128 kbps mp3s.

The player has four playable characters to choose from, each character specializing in his or her types of weapons and fighting style. Each of the characters has their own unique starting level and their own story, although the storyline differences between them disappear fairly early into the game. Most new players love the Barbarian, with his two-handed swords and cool-looking attacks, although he might be a bit too difficult for the first-time players. A balanced choice for a first playthrough would be the Knight, with his efficient use of shields and easy to master combos. Additionally, his starting level was the one bundled with the demo of the game, so it was meticulously polished and demonstrates the game''s mood and gameplay features very well. The Amazon is also a good choice for first-timers, though playing with her feels almost cheatingly easy at times, with her long-range attacks and the ability to quickly roll far enough out of harm''s way (although her starting level is actually quite the opposite of ''cheatingly easy''!). I definitely wouldn''t recommend playing with the Dwarf on your first playthrough, though, since playing with him has a very high chance of rage quits and throwing the keyboard out of the window in frustration. In any case, once you''ve completed the game with one character, what could be better than starting it over with another one, just to see how well you''ll manage this time? BOD has fantastic replayability. Besides, over the years, the fan community has created countless mods and singleplayer maps to check out, some of these maps rivaling the original campaign in their detail and complexity.

Perhaps the only serious downside of the game is its story. It''s not that the storyline is inherently bad – on the contrary, the game is set in a world heavily influenced by Zoroastrian teachings and the Earth-that-was a few dozen centuries ago; the story is a prime example of the monomyth found in many cultures and has a couple of (admittedly, fairly cliched) plot twists. The real problem is that the storyline could have easily not existed here at all. Most of the time, all you''re doing is going from one door to another, trying to find keys and gems while fighting abominations and evil guys and admiring the atmosphere – and wondering why you''re here. It''s not that the story is nonsentical, has plot holes or is unrelated to what''s actually happening on the screen – but the only times when it actually surfaces are level intros and intermission screens with the narrator saying a few words about the place, and occasional cutscenes that are few and far between. To figure out what''s actually going on, the player has to pay rigorous attention to these small bits of information, then piece them together and speculate on things that were left unsaid or just mentioned briefly in the passing. If you go through the trouble of actually doing that, the storyline does indeed make sense, justifying everything that happens (or, at least, most of it) and making the ending truly satisfying. If not... The storyline could have just as easily been something along the lines of "everything in this world wants to kill you" and it would have affected the gameplay just the same.

Some people have found the controls to be difficult at first, though not exactly awkward. The core feature of BOD – combat – relies on the attack and block functions and combinations of movement keys that result in directional attacks and weapon-specific combos. Lack of strafe outside of combat situations is something that many have found confusing and unexpected.

To conclude the list of downsides, the game''s development was somewhat rushed during the last few months of production, leading to some gameplay features and parts of storyline being abandoned. Various signs of this are noticeable throughout the game, such as the presence of a different type of bow that you never get to use, the aforementioned heavily fragmented storyline and various minor bugs that may happen every now and then. There are major bugs as well, but nowadays most of them are caused by the game being pretty dated already and not always running perfectly on modern machines and modern Windows. One of the features that definitely suffered from the rushed development is multiplayer, which was left not as exciting as it could potentially be and clearly underdeveloped – nowadays, it requires a considerable amount of effort to set up a match since the game supports only LAN connections; a VPN software like Hamachi would come in handy in this case.

The game has aged fairly well and will sometimes work out of the box on a modern version of Windows like Windows 7. Players experiencing crashes, glitched fonts and such are advised to google "OpenGL Raster" for Blade Of Darkness – it''s a fan-made (as far as I know) alternative to DirectX Raster DLLs that come bundled with the game; OpenGL offers far better stability these days (the game might look a bit dark with it, so you may have to adjust the brightness and gamma additionally in the game). Occasionally, some cutscenes will not work as intended (usually resulting in the character walking in circles and other similar issues); this can usually be solved by temporarily switching back to DirectX Raster (even if only for this one cutscene) or toggling VSync (it''s the "swap buffers" parameter in the "Misc" tab in the OpenGL Raster settings window). If you''re having troubles with the fog being too thick to see anything in some locations, google "Fog Fix" (sometimes spelled "FogFix") which is a minor mod that solves this problem (it doesn''t affect gameplay). Lastly, just for the record, the game is locked at the 4:3 aspect ratio so if you''ll set up a widescreen resolution for it, everything on the screen will be simply stretched horizontally. As of early 2015, there''s still no fix for this, although the developer of the ENB mod for BOD (google "Blade Of Light" if you''re into that sort of thing) is currently experimenting with some ideas. If you''re reading this review in the far future, go take a look if they succeeded. The best (though not always available) solution these days is to set a 4:3 resolution like 1440x1080 for a 1920x1080 monitor and then choose letterboxing the image instead of always forcing fullscreen stretching in the settings of your graphics card or your monitor.

Despite these flaws, Blade Of Darkness is truly unrivaled when it comes to gameplay. If you haven''t heard about this hidden gem and if you don''t mind a game that won''t let you stroll through it casually, you should definitely give it a try. These days, it can be obtained on GOG for just a few bucks.

What makes a good Resident Evil game? Unrelated Characters, weird voice "acting" choices, and a story written by the Lisa Trevor of scripts. Good thing all of this will hit you like a ton of bricks, right from the start of the game. Trust me when I say, you will quickly know what the hell you just got yourself into.

UNGH! MY HEAD! I TOTALLY FORGOT EVERYTHING!!!

Yes. This is what the whole game is weighing on. From the start of you crashing your helicopter, you wake up with a headache. Sadly, you don''t have any aspirin. So as a side affect, you can''t remember anything.  This is the point you realize you can walk, and have this reticle to aim with...and...and HOLY S**T UNLIMITED HANDGUN AMMO!? Good thing this game is called "Survivor", or I would have assumed this game was going to be easy...

WELCOME TO "THE MECHANICS"

So yea, you walk around in this stiff "FPS" mechanic. Where when aiming, it''s just an on screen reticle, you move on the locked screen, and shoot enemies with. You can walk around, but walking and turning is the same left pad. It''s as amazing as it sounds. Even for the time it came out, it''s still awkward, and never feels fully comfortable. The game also always displays: Weapon, Ammo, Condition. I guess they knew since it would be in First Person, you couldn''t really give off any indication of your condition. Good thing they got creative, and just slapped that on the screen with everything else. Oh also no chest for items/weapons. You''re a walking chest.

Yea, the game never really has you backtrack. There are different ways to go about the game, when progressing forward, but nothing to send you running back and forth to unlock doors. The choices are not obvious, and kind of confuse you why you never went through "that one door" as you move on. It''s cool though, make the right choice, and you''ll see some Gorilla-Hunk-Ninjas pretty early on! The game also seems to really have no puzzles. A lot of things to pick up and read, but puzzles, naaahhh. Survivors don''t do puzzles

For a guy who has no idea who he is, or what''s going on, he''s sure as hell down to kill stuff. It''s what really gives Resident Evil that "scary" element.

The reputation behind the game was its massive delays since 1999 as the company revised/reconstructed the game to make it what they believed was a game worthy of playing. Headfirst Productions did in fact achieve something out this, though many problem coming with it too. This game is a diamond in the ''rough'' part and the rough is hard to avoid. The game is plagued with bugs, some in the gameplay and other segments that are impossible to pass unless without a certain patch, code or even the right version of Windows (XP version) to run it. It personally left me puzzled on why the company couldn''t iron out all the bugs in time but surely there were reasons. Another problem is the game hasn''t aged well. The character models are quite bizarre to look at, sometimes almost alien (even normal models), the audio design is quite weak such as the gun sounds and some environmental effects.

So what''s so good about such a game with many flaws? When overlooking the ''rough'' (I mentioned earlier), and seeing the diamond, Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth is a fantastic experience due to how well written dialogue, characters personality, immersive and frightening it is to be embodied where it sets you in. 

The story is probably the second strongest aspect of the game, you play as a detective called Jack Walters, a man with a reputation for solving crimes even if there wasn''t any evidence. His character is a textbook one but is later developed more through out his witnessing of violence and horror. He is encountered by something horrific after investigating a cultic group, he is later locked up in the asylum due to terrifying event he experience with the cult, though later released from the asylum only to be called up to look for a missing person in the isolated town of Innsmouth. Venturing to the location he unravels a sinister group in which the whole town has kept a secret. 

The story unravels more and more as you play as Jack, reading notes and books on the towns history shows that there''s a morbid side that is very effective if you''re sucked into it. The story never stops giving you more detail about what''s going on, all the time the new information given about the town and its people, provides a sickening feeling that is uneasy on the mind. 

Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of The Earth story isn''t the best part about this game, but it is the atmosphere, that the developers made to make the world seem more believable. The world you''re set in, is a dark and messy place, the design and textures of old rusted houses, factories and the sickening look of the Innsmouth people all help greatly with the unsettling atmosphere. 
When utilised with the gameplay, there''s a effective aspect to this. The game for the first-half, makes you powerless to fend off against enemies. You are attacked by a mob, in which you cannot do anything to defend yourself, nor can you hide, instead the only option is to run away. The game doesn''t make it easy for you to do some, your enemies are fast and powerful, sometimes you''ll have to lock doors and bar them with anything you can find the room to buy yourself a few seconds, the game never stop making it intense. The other aspect is the gunplay which make your character though a little overpowered when fighting against certain enemies. Though this may seem like a down side to the horror; it doesn''t!
The game is very much Lovecraftian (well it is based on a Lovecraft lore), it implements a mental system to the game, in which traumatic experience will send your character into a paranoid and weakened psychological state. Your character will start whispering to himself and the games visuals will start to get messy and hazy. Such implementation is executed perfectly. It provides some of the best moments in the game.

It maybe bias if I write the review for this game but I still feel the need of it. 

- First note: 

7554-Glorious Memories Revived is the very very first major game from an independence Vietnamese company calls Emobi Games. But before 7554, no one had any single idea who is Emobi Games. So when they announced 7554, everyone was so hyped that we finally make a real game, not another rip-off rubbish from any other game. The hype hit the Vietnamese internet community with tons of rumours and questions, people even thought that the game never make it because Vietnamese censorship. However, here we are, we made it after a lot of supporting for the company. So I definitely feel that it deserves my respect even if it is a potato.

- Experience:

+Pros: 

Decent graphic, sounds which really did "revive" Indochina war from 1945 with creepy old town, rice field, jungle road and military camp. It did enough to recreate the Vietnam''s environment from those war days. It is really amazing that we can look at the French colonial Vietnam once again in modern time and many of those building in early part of the game still here now. Even the Metropole hotel is still a hotel nowadays. The weapon arsenal was alright I guess, it could have been much better.

+Cons:

Honestly, the graphic is definitely from Call of Duty, because they used the same engine to develop the game. It makes me first feel like I was playing a huge community mod. Some sound bugs and graphic bugs did "bug" me somehow, although there was no crash, I some time stuck on the top of a truck or between tree. 

The AI was not that well made though, they were quiet poor. When you face them and try a meelee, they go for instant kill on you. So it was quiet weird. 

Storyline was okay but it could have been done 10 times better because the plot was very potential.

+ Effort: (10/10)

Emobi Games was brave to announce that their game will be sold $12 for each copy. Because in Vietnam, copyrights infringement is 98% so a lot of people will basically wait for crack which made Emobi to decide to sell their game cheaply in hope more people will buy it. However, 7554 still a total failure from them. They spent around $750.000 to make the game and they were only able to sold $50.000. They later withdrew from independence offline game and now concentrate on online MMORPG. Which I am pretty sad for that. I wish Emobi Games did not only launch the game in Vietnam but also launch it in overseas, they could maybe make some profit out of 7554.

- Conclusion:

 If any major company made 7554, they would be happy if I give them a 4/10. However, I actually feel for the developer and their restless effort so I decided to give them a 7/10. If you have a spare $12 somewhere, you can go and give it a try. It is really fun.

insert into reviews (id, content, title, rating, user_id, game_id, created_at, updated_at) values (348, 'I''m going to break this down by category:

Story
-------------
The story for this game, and your interactions with that story, is this game''s big selling point. This game comes from the age of linear RPGs, when you followed a story and you liked it. The game features a number of side missions which do an amazing job of fleshing out the world and can change how NPCs view you. This game takes place in four hubs, where you can find side quests and generally romp around, and a number of smaller areas you go to for main quests where you have more specific goals. The story is very well-grounded, especially for a game about vampires, and never tries to reach above its means. It''s pretty close to perfect.

Graphics
-------------
The graphics of this game aren''t terribly impressive, since the game is eleven years old. However, they follow a consistent and interesting aesthetic which gives flavor the the world and really brings the game to life.

There are a couple of graphical glitches I''ve noticed:
- The first is that, while in the sewers, the water reflections will often forget to update, meaning the water reflects the world from one point of view and you see the world from an entirely different point of view. It looks pretty weird and annoyed me a lot.
- The second glitch is that objects near the top and bottom of the screen will often disappear. This includes things like parts of buildings and the ground. I suspect the developers implemented a visibility culling algorithm, so they didn''t render objects that were outside of the player''s field of view, but they''re culling too many things. This issue amused me.
- The third is more of a performance issue than a graphics issue, but it''s related to graphics so I''ll put it here. Whenever particles appear on screen, the game experiences massive frame drops. Normally, I can run this game at 60+ frames per second. Throw in some particles, and I get like 10. No joke. This isn''t too much of an issue, since there aren''t many particle systems in the game, but if you use some of your vampire powers in first-person mode you get this massive slowdown, and whenever supernatural enemies die they explode into particles which looks cool but, again, causes massive framerate drops. V:TM:B was built with the Source engine, which didn''t have any sort of particle system until Half-Life 2: Episode 2, so I suspect whoever at Troika programmed the particle systems for this game did a pretty bad job of it.

Audio
------------
This game is from 2004, so the audio isn''t super amazing high-quality noiseless recordings, but that''s okay. I rather liked the way the dialogue sounded. I''m not enough of an audio engineer to describe it very well, but it fits very well into this game.

The audio does have an issue that holds my rating back. When you wear headphones, it sounds a lot like the game plays the dialogue tracks separately in each ear, with one ear''s audio delayed slightly from the other ear''s. This sounds bad and hurts the overall audio quality.

Controls
-----------
This is the game''s weakest point. Although movement feels pretty alright, combat is awful. When you click to attack, if the attack animation, enemy getting hit animation, sound of the enemy getting hit, and the number that tells you how much damage you did all occur within one second of each other, you''re pretty lucky. What''s interesting is that, when enemies attack you, those things pretty much happen at the same time. What''s also interesting is that pretty much every time an enemy hits you, you stagger back, so if you''re fighting a group of enemies who would be no trouble individually, they''ll attack you in sequence so you stay staggered and can''t do anything. It''s really annoying, especially since you only sometimes stagger enemies.

I played a melee character, so I can''t comment on the gun play.

Fun
-----------
This game is definitely fun. The storyline is incredibly compelling, and the world makes sense in a way that few other games have accomplished. The character customization allows you to play a wide variety of character types, and leveling up certain skills unlocks dialogue options that also really help define your character. You can seduce people, then suck their blood in the middle of the street and no one cares, which amuses me to no end.', 'Some inconsequential', 3, 19, 11, str_to_date('2018-11-20 06:12:38', '%Y-%m-%d %T'), str_to_date('2018-11-20 06:12:38', '%Y-%m-%d %T'));

Freeman''s role as a scientist, contradicts and breaks the stereotype of action protagonists in FPS''. 

The action in the game is much different to previous FPS'' in the genre. Half-Life pushes a more cinematic style and form similar to that of films. The experience engaged in the game are: Military gun fights, disaster like events, fighting aliens and even up against special ops forces. The game make you feel like you''re in an action film, similar to that of John Woo films. The action though sometimes comes to a halt as the game lets you use some brain power (puzzles segements) to pass certain areas. Half-Life perfectly accomplishes this with action. Other things like AI is brilliant for the time as well, especially with military soldiers will try to flank your position by talking to each other. Most of the human AI are never walking targets, they all want to stay alive and desperately do so.   
The game is a marvel in its gameplay, though some may consider to be a bit outdated. The main flaw in the game has nothing to do with the experience provided, instead but the story. Though the story expresses itself in many ways, the game doesn''t pack as much punch to be compared to any point and click adventure of the time. Though nor should it be, but with such innovations in other aspects of the game, the story seems minor and limited in detail and depth.

The game is nevertheless different in which will have different reactions for audience looking for a particular gameplay. For one thing, Hitman Absolution may not be an appealing game for those who have played the games in the previous series (like myself). What has made it quite a disappointment is how they have moulded the gameplay more story focused way. This of course is not a flaw of the game, but for the Hitman series being focusing on how you execute the mission was what made the Hitman series so stimulating in the first place. IO Interactive executed this part poorly and hindered the main focus of what the game was about originally. Nevertheless the story is much more stronger than it predecessors. Again you play as Agent 47 trying to protect/save the girl from those wanting to use her for their own evil deeds. Agent 47''s character is much more reflective in this game, many moments in cutscenes, shows the humanity that 47 possesses within himself. Though quite odd for the series, this brings a new perspective on 47''s role as an assassin. 

Gameplay-wise, nearly everything that was in the previous hitman games is in this one as well, though with more features and tweaks that were made in this one. One thing is for sure, is the assassination are still pleasurable to do and executing them in a variety of ways. Though not as much as the previous game, it still has enough to be considerable as replay value. Some of the added tweaks is the storing of multiple bodies in containers and also hiding there with them to avoid enemies. Others such as more stealth sequences and gunplay have been improved from the previous games and are much more fluid than before. The biggest downside is the disguise system. The series has often prided themselves for using disguises as a means to sneaking past the enemy and getting the end target. The developers have tacked on one of the worst features destroy another key element of the game. If using a disguise of an occupation in the area. The NPC''s will detect you in a second flat. This hinders the game so much that it makes it incredibly hard, especially on more difficult missions. Though playing on easier levels will give you an instinct mode which will allow you move pass your enemies without them detecting you. Though this is problematic as well cause it always runs out too quickly and if in a situation needing to get out of and your meter is empty, good luck getting a perfect score. It''s another redundant and flawed aspect to the game. Last but not least the score meter has been changed too, compared to Hitman Blood Money which gave you a list of result on how you executed you mission (I won''t go into anymore detail than this), instead here it''s nothing more than a score meter in which killing enemies, not hiding their bodies or any sort of lethal forces minus'' points of your score. Not only is this annoying, but it limits how you want to play the game properly. 

Graphically the game is very good looking, with much variety in the locations you''re in, the detail and the texture design all are wonderful. Audio is excellent as well. Story characters are much different to the previous games, your enemies are more gross and bizarre in their own little way, with much more character behind who they are.

For one thing they are both able to establish themselves in a time period that is realistic and truthful to it. In this one, you''re immersed in its culture and lingo of the 40''s to 50''s. It seems that 2K Czech have done above beyond job to provide a beautiful city established in two different seasons in different times. They provide a game that doesn''t betray the period. As you continue into the game you''ll see the development from everything from cars, buildings to clothing. The game is never anachronistic to its setting. Such development is one which I appreciate the most about Mafia II compared to the original game.

Mafia II''s story is decent though not quite as dramatic or emotionally attaching as the original and even to other gangster genre games. The main characters and their personalities are diverse though and with many characters to meet which provide cut-scenes with great moments. Mafia II''s great weakness is its lack of focus on how it uses its story in the world. By this I mean the interaction in the world except specific place makes the open-world element of the game feel barren and redundant. It seems around 50-70% of the mission are designated in location which were specifically designed for the mission themselves. It doesn''t help much as the world it immerses you in is quite amazing. In the previous game, though that can be similar parallels to this issue, Mafia I still provides a Free Roam mode and does use up more of its locations in the city. Mafia II provides no more replay value to its original. The game''s world feels wasted. 

II''s gameplay though during mission is quite excellent, the gunplay is smooth and slick, similar to that of GTA IV''s gunplay. Mafia II provides the weapons that fit the occupation (Gangster), it feels great to fire your weapon at the enemy. Graphically the game is technically and artistic beautiful to look at, character models though do sometimes seem a bit dated with some shoddy speaking animation, though nothing too bad.

Mafia is set in a era that is unexpected to the gaming world, the old-time feel the era of the 1930''s. The game starts from the early 1930''s near to the 40''s, though the game shows an astounding amount of change, in its detail of the world and how the culture shifts from one to another. This is one of the dedicated parts to the games production. The developers show that they care more about the story and the setting it''s located in. The change of time after each mission will unlock a certain area that wasn''t restricted before, the areas will all have different music to them, in which it helps provide an accurate look and feel of the place. The music is the classic songs of the era. Most notably the song ''The Mooch'' by the famed Jazz musician Duke Ellington. Indeed Mafia''s care with the setting also shows how much the story and characters are developed in this game. Mafia''s story is one of rags to riches and how all violence leads to many consequences. Though being a standard overview of the entire game, the detail of each mission and aspects of dialogue and storytelling is wholly unique. The game provides a world for you to look and see, without limiting it to certain locations. Though mostly the game will provide a ton of unique location specific for that mission, the game''s world can feel sometimes being wasted away. But not as much. 
The environment and changing of years relates to the setting very well. The game provides many location where your jobs or missions have unique interaction with the environment. This is a immersive technique that is pull off masterfully. 
Graphically the game is fantastic, though some textures and voice animations are sometimes a bit choppy, the game is still artistic well design, this is also thanks to the time periods that you go through and the changing of culture. The game also uses a very cinematic feel the cut-scenes and events, certainly there''s an element of the melodrama genre. The gunplay is sometimes though can be left to be desired. It''s still consist but sometimes a bit of an irritation to do at certain point of a mission. Another feature that is unique is how it deals with realistic car handling .The game provides different cars from different time period and how they change and handle overtime. Mission that involve car driving can provide to be quite frustrating even if it is realistic. The biggest problem with the game though is the lack of replay value for the open-world.

Each level/area, is something to behold. It has inspiring landscapes and dream-like sunsets. The texture pallet didn''t seem repetitive and every nook and cranny is filled with the utmost detail and the still frame cinematics manage to push forward the story rather than hold it back. And it''s all by hand too. I honestly wish I knew more about art, but if I had to try and pin it, I would say somewhere around the pastel look is how this game is. The game''s artist "JenZee" actually has a Deviantart page where you can view all of his work.

SoundDesign: The actual effects in Transistor were very nicely designed and have a good variety with each enemy and each attack. They all sounded of high quality and were believable. Although, there were moments where I was spamming a certain attack and it was the same sound effect every time and it did annoy me. But that''s just a personal peeve. The voice acting was also a work of art. Logan Cunningham, who is coming back to Supergiant from doing Bastion, brought Transistor to life. He had a very smooth performance and it never sounded like he was "nagging". But, the music, Oh Lord let''s talk about this music. Darren Korb is now in my top 10 composers. Once again, he flawlessly executed a video game. If you''re familiar with his other works you''ll recognize his eclectic influences all nicely wrapped into multiple tracks. If I had to guess a genre it would be something crazy insane like Digital-folk-hiphop or something. I don''t know, but it''s all there, guitars, the beats, harps, accordions, synths, a little bit of everything. After buying the soundtrack (as I did with Bastion) it''s been on repeat all day. And if you liked Ashley Lynn Barrett in Bastion, then you''ll love her in Transistor. Darren snatched her right back into the studio and made yet another masterpiece. The overall mood of the OST is depressing, moody, dark, but  uplifting at the same time. And because there''s a music filter within the game I caught myself pausing, unpausing, and Turn()ing within the game just so I could hear all the different versions of one track seamlessly transition into one another. A definite recommendation.

Gameplay: Transistor kind of has you on that off-angle-top-down-view (called Isometric). It features real time combat with a strategy based feature called Turn(). When you press the command, the battlefield freezes and you can plan out your attack according to however you see fit, and then when you hit the command again, Red goes off and executes all the moves and combos at light speed, and then you wait for it to recharge, it''s really cool and at times can even save your life. Now when I played this game I only died I believe, twice. But TECHNICALLY I probably died about 99kajillion times. The way death works in this game is that you have four slots for attacks called Functions. Each function has two upgrade slots that you use your other acquired functions for certain buffs. As well you can apply a Passive Upgrade to your character, for a constant battlefield effect. Now when you run out of health, you lose your functions one by one. Then when you run out of health on your last function, it''s game over. Supergiant is very forgiving in this game and they don''t want you to die, they give every chance possible. At very few times did I feel cheated and only yelled out "Bullspit!" one time. But even then, one of the buildings got in the way of the borders of the battlefield. Usually when something like that happens the engine will "hollow out" the structure so that you can see the main character at all times. Well this game did not do that and actually caused me a death. But if you happen to be dying too much you can hit your own little personal beach house called the Sandbox and practice different moves, combos, etc. There''s doorways that lead to speed, resistance, and other challenges alike to hone your skills. And upon each mission that''s completed, you unlock a piece of the soundtrack to listen to AND get granted experience so you can stay ahead of the games rising difficulty. I spent so much time there, that at one point, I did forget where I was and upon returning to Cloudbank, Transistor said, "Back to reality...". If the game is too easy, you can activate what''s called a Limiter to debuff the main character somehow, but the trade-off is it will give you an extra percentage on top of what you earned for every battle you win. So in a way, you choose the difficulty of the game at any time. Also when you beat it, there''s a Recursion mode where you keep everything from your last playthrough and go at it again.

It''s by no means a bad game, but its flaws make it impossible to consider it to be ever a solid game. Dead Island for the most part, is one of many zombie horror games out there. It dumps you into a sandbox world on an island in which the undead have sprung up and started to kill innocent people. Locations of nice tropical springs, the dirty slums of the islands'' city and to the swampy jungles. In summary it has all the locations for you to fight zombies in and to tackle the environment at the same time. 

Now when playing the game the first thing that is very much noticeable is the fact that the graphical style of the game conflict with the actual themes that they''re trying to present. Character animations and facial designs look goofy at best, with either eyes bulging out hilariously or a bleak and stiff looking faces that have no emotions to them. Sam B has to be my favourite character only because he has the goofy animations, voice acting and silly expressions on his face in every cutscene. Other graphical problems that were a bother, was the outdated feel of the game (not bad just outdated). Much of the textures look very much blotchy and low-resolution with the anti-aliasing covering it up in the worse possible way, making it look like someone had smeared vaseline all over the textures. This lessens the atmosphere greatly and doesn''t feel like a serious game with serious themes. 
From a story standpoint the game tries to make it seem like it''s a very serious game, with character talking about what horrible things have happened. Dialogue and cutscenes that were meant to be emotional though fall flat. Overall there''s nothing special about it. The story was more of a turnoff and a cliche than anything else.

The meat of the game is the gameplay, choosing from one of four character with their own special abilities and skills provide more replay value to the game. The gameplay has this semi-realistic aspect to it. Every time you swing your weapon it will use some of your stamina up but also may hurt your opponent by braking it limbs. This makes every fight when encountering zombies to use your stamina wisely. Consider that, zombies in the game are not just slow walking zombies but various in their abilities. Some are generic walkers, but others are runners (infected), strong zombies (thugs) and much more. Though this does spice the gameplay up a lot, the way that the game throws them at you can be a problem. 
Dying in the game can be very quick due to how many come at you. The infected are possibly the most annoying of the bunch and had led me to many deaths that are often unfair. Another problem can be the fact that your hits could be totally on target with any of their body parts but completely miss them, not taking any damage. I found moments where I was infuriated due to these problems. Other problems is how it paces some gameplay modes. If you play the character that specialises in armed weapons then over a quarter of the game (which is about 5 hours in) have you not using or finding a gun. There''re problems all across the board for this game but somehow fighting zombies and landing perfect hits are very much satisfying. Pretty much this is one of the saving points of the game. 

Another pro, would be the weapons system, which has a variety of classes, types and modification which make it much more enjoyable to use. Lately it is quite a long game, it doesn''t just provide you with a main story but also many side missions which can help level-up, most of them being quite enjoyable.

They both had their good and their bad points but I will not go further into this with this review. I wanted the memories of the wonderful world of Thedas freshly burned into my mind before entering an unknown chapter of the Dragon Age world. When I finally started Dragon Age Inquisition I was astonished at how beautiful everything looked. The graphics are amazing. I did notice however that BioWare learned how specular maps worked and that they placed these in every texture there was with the EA overlords in the background yelling: "FLASHIER! WE NEED MORE FLASHY STUFF!". 

The second thing I noticed was something that made me sad. The PC controls were terrible! In dragon age: Origins and Dragon Age II you could pause the game to select and auto attack/loot certain objects or monsters with your mouse. This function was mostly removed. They did keep the auto attack function in but it becomes very glitchy when using special attacks from the hotbar. I also had to stand on top op something lootable to even loot it. The character wouldn''t automatically walk over to the item. This did bother me and I went searching for something to resolve this problem. On forums I found others who agreed with my opinion but that there was nothing to do.

I tried to resist the urge to quit and adapt to the new game mechanics. After a few hours of frustration however, I began to notice the scope of the world and the story. It was amazing. The story was exactly what I would expect from BioWare. It triumphs over the story that Skyrim has! Each land had it''s very distinct features. In comparison; Kirkwall from Dragon Age II seemed about half the size of the starter location. This was very refreshing to find out. I also loved the evolution of the inquisition. You could claim landmarks, recruit agents and companions etc. All to increase the influence and power of the inquisition. BioWare also removed the repetitive waves of monsters from Dragon Age II and they made almost every battle exciting even with the shortcomings of the controls.', 'Terrible Start, Wonderful continuation', 3, 1, 18, str_to_date('2018-11-20 06:12:51', '%Y-%m-%d %T'), str_to_date('2018-11-20 06:12:51', '%Y-%m-%d %T'));

It suggests a massive world with a beautiful back-story, while restraining itself from telling too much of that back-story, so that the game is not bogged down in needless dialogue and reading. This provides the game with a dark and mysterious feel, contributing to the overall feel of the game. The graphics, as I mentioned in my introduction, contribute a great deal to the feel of the game. This is partly, I think, because of the sophistication of the story and certain aspects of the graphics that create an appealing contrast. For example, the art style and bit-like appearance is contrasted with the amazing detail included in the game, and even the rain pouring down becomes beautiful in front of the scenes experienced. 
I won''t get into the story too much, but I will say that it was surprising and intriguing-this is the type of game that leaves you contemplating many different questions for weeks after you have completed it (I finished it a week ago and am still thinking about it). The main flaw in the game is that the dialogue can seemed forced at times, in an attempt to explain certain aspects of the story-even when the player has already figured it out.

In 2008 when the first Left 4 Dead was published, I was in middle school in an Asian country. When I came to the Internet-gaming shop close to school, I saw every one is playing it. Quickly dig in and enjoy the game, great co-op, great voice acting, good special zombies (Boomer, hunter, tank...), smart map, well story. I started from there. In high school, 2009, me and my buddies even created a team to go around in the city to challenge or play with other gamers and group. Although this game is not a big hit in my place, still it has many many players when it first released. So this game is not only a game for, it also a memory of our friendship and hours of non stop action, both versus and co-op. 

+ Experience:

Pro: 
- Graphic: Great, amazing, all the zombies, maps, special infected, characters was well made. All those bloody action, the thrill of being pulled or grabbed by Hunter, Smoker or Jockey was awesome. Source Engine creates an amazing atmosphere for L4D and even better for L4D2. Cloudy sky, foggy city, dim tunnel, dark and scary sewage..... 

- Characters: The best thing I think is each character can express their feeling in different situation, such as laughing, seeing a theme park, see Mid night rider, or even get ride by a Jockey, their scream and face expression is amazing. 

- Sound: Very well done, all the music and sound when a horde is approaching, tank coming, special infected closing down, I feel like my body going through an adrenalin rush. Voice acting is also a huge plus. 

- Game play: Good campaign, Great Co-op, Amazing Versus. When L4D first released, only Co-op was available at that time. When they updated the versus mode, and L4D2 was released, the sh*t just hit the fan. I enjoy it so much. Weapon arsenal is well done, although there is not likes hundred of choices, but every gamers can choose a weapon fit their play style: Shotgun for close combat, Sniper Rifle for range, DMR for quick sniper ,assault rifle for all purpose. Then in L4D2 melee weapons join the game. Although they are melee, each of them have different characteristic, such as katana has long range and swing very fast, machete is fast and deadly, baseball bat and cricket bat although slower but crush the enemies. Sometime, special weapon shows up such as M60, chain saw, grenade launcher, foam hand give a special twist to the game too. Along with a right amount of med kit, pills, special ammo, explosives scattering around every map, the players feel like they are well supported in L4D2. 

- Special infected: The originals were good, the seconds were even better. And also with the common special infected such as "the guy in the fire suit", "the guy in police suit", "the mud man", "the clown". 

- Console command: Easy to learn

- Modding: *Modding intensifies*

Cons:

The only cons I have is the online server, in Oceania or Asia, there are hardly 4,5 servers which have ping below 100 and they are all occupied most of the time. Sometime I find myself forced to leave the game because just could not find a good multiplayer server to play. And the server browser search and filter is also very limited. Even if we don''t want to play some dumb mode, it shows up and it takes time to get in game and get out. It needs a better filter. 

+ Conclusion: Amazing game for zombie genre lover. I give it a 9 out of 10. Everything in this game is almost perfect and the modding community makes it even better. With extra maps, campaign, weapons skin, the game can be play for a long time.

You''ll constantly be fighting against the current if you try to bumrush through everything. In the beginning, it creates and introduces everything with little tutorials to help you through the first couple hours because there is a learning curve to this game. I was personally wondering how the events of the second game would effect the third and it sits you down, while getting a haircut and shave (that grows back in real time), and you actually set the game up yourself. If you didn''t play the second Witcher it''s ok, just pick the options that most appeals to you, but for me, I picked all of the things that I did in the second and now I have to go back and play again with different options because there are HUGE chunks of game I know I''m missing out on. Projekt Red does is right. A character doesn''t just make a little cameo, you fight, talk, plunder, drink, and sometimes even make it to the bed with certain characters (I actually lost count of all the women I slept with). But much more importantly it sets a new standard for interactivity and choice , where even seemingly minor choices that you make in a side quest ends up coming back to affect the main story hours later. Every game developer should be studying the quests of the Witcher 3, particularly the side quests and how they are deep, meaningful, and way more interesting than most game''s Main Storylines. We often hear developers say how "the players choices will affect the game world", but this is the second time that I have ever felt that to be genuinely true, aside from the second Witcher. It completely blows the simplistic Bethesda and Bioware approach out of the water in this respect. And even when you think you''re making a good decision all sorts of unforeseen consequences end up happening in the world, with even entire villages going barren because of a "good" decision you made, or re-inhabiting a town because you eradicated the bandits that raided it. It is genuinely the greatest quest and choice outcome system ever made, by miles. Going back to playing the quests of Fallout, Mass Effect, any Elder Scrolls game after this is a MASSIVE step back. I honestly want to just go in and talk about every little detail about this game and how phenomenal my experience was but that would take too long. This game is honestly a staple and a standard. This game is The Ocarina of Time of the new consoles. Nothing is skimped out on, and everything has the utmost attention to detail. The world also feels like a real place, everything as if its handcrafted, instead of the generic copy-paste that plagues today''s game worlds.  There were points in the game where I was attending concerts, acting in plays, fistfighting a bear in a fight club, sailing the seas and diving for sunken treasure, betting on horse races, and kicking ass at card tournaments. There is nothing this game doesn''t have. It is all there. Even the character''s voice acting and expression is incredible, the facial expressions are up there with LA Noire. You genuinely end up watching the highly detailed NPC faces to try and figure out their intentions. And there is rarely a good vs. bad narrative, its almost always gray and morally unclear. You''ll end up pondering your decisions days after you step away from the screen, and the dark world doesn''t shy away from some very uncomfortable topics, it treats you like an adult. It will renew your faith in an increasingly troubled industry, and fill even the most jaded gamer with a sense of wonder of how a game this big, complex, and well made is even possible. After my 100+ hours of just ONE playthrough, there was only a couple things I nitpicked on. When riding your mount (whenever it wasn''t pissing you off) and following/conversing on horseback, the characters, instead of yelling at each other because you have the distance and ambient sounds all around you (like in Red Dead Redemption), they spoke calmly to one another as if they were sitting at the fireplace. The sailing is nothing like Assassin''s Creed sailing, instead it''s geared more like driving. And the bugs. Oh Lord, the countless bugs. This game definitely needed it''s own can of Raid, or Orkin, or something because it was bad. It wasn''t New Vegas bad, or Skyrim on PS3 bad, but there was one time where I ran into an infinite loading screen and had to restart the game. That was the worst one.

The artwork is absolutely gorgeous-it is clear that the game designer really was working on a labour of love. The music is perfect for the game, and helps to add to the immersive emotional experience. The characters themselves are whimsical yet austere-they can be silly, but not in an annoying way. In particular, Fidget-the protagonist''s sidekick, is a delightful contrast in innocence to the world. Her experience gradually grows her character in extremely subtle yet real ways. Yet, this is often unnoticed beside the delicious character development of the protagonist himself-Dust. Dust is a warrior with an unknown past, which is gradually revealed. Even this plot usage, which can be a bit prosaic in some games, gets a marvelous face-lift. 
The story is entrancing, as is the world that it takes place in. You quickly forget that you are playing a side-view platformer, and the style makes it easier to fall into the world due to the easy-to-master controls. The fighting is tight and responsive, with enough variety to make it continually interesting throughout the game. I would recommend the use of a controller (that is what I did), but a friend of mine used a keyboard and mouse and he has told me that he found the same thing. Very responsive and tight controlling. You will not die because of the controls, you will die because of your own inabilities. 
The con to the game that I can see is that the boss battles become fairly simplistic once you realize that you can simply dust-storm back and forth (for the most part) until the boss dies.

A beautifully crafted wasteland that feels vast and empty. The particle effects (smoke, dust, fire, etc.) are nothing short of professional and was probably the best looking part of the game. Each enemy camp, cave, blown up gas station, underground cavern are all unique and you won''t notice any repeating interiors. A lot of crafting and detail went into the areas of exploration and it shows. This is easily the best part of the game, the visuals.

SOUNDDESIGN: Sad to say though there''s nothing too special too denote here. The explosions are really the only thing that is hi-fi in this game, or as far as sound goes, stood out and somewhat made you feel it. The soundtrack was a sub-par score. No melodies that get stuck in your head, no catchy tunes to hum along to, just background noise. But I''ll give the voice actors some credit. While you meet wildly different characters, none of them stand out. I think it''s because they''re all far too left field. Each main character is quirky and crazy in their own right, but in a way caused them all to blend together. But what was really cool was when during the most important cutscenes in the game the audio didn''t match up with the video. Not like it mattered because the SFX sucked anyways, but that''s just another tick that takes away from the experience.

GAMEPLAY: Now in this game, there is a lot to do. The wasteland is very big, which is also its drawback. It''s too big, and going from one place to another, collecting scrap for your upgrades, and destroying enemy camps to lower the threat level in allied territory feels more like a chore. Kind of like when your parents would tell you to clean your room. It wasn''t fun and you only did it because you had to. There is a lot of mechanics to be had in this game though. Mad Max is all about the cars, and in this game, there are a multiple of cars you can collect, fight, customize, everything. But what I don''t get is why in the world would you have the main mechanic in your game be broken and wonky as hell. The driving in Mad Max is atrocious. From the seizure-like camera to the street mechanics themselves. You will find yourself constantly doing flips and turns and making bad turns and sharp corners, running into walls and off cliffs and pretty much anything else that constitutes bad driving (refer to the hallway car scene in the first Austin Powers). There was more than one mission that was all vehicle based (not counting the race side missions) and I wanted to quit the game. I say it all the time: There is a very big difference between challenging, and frustrating, and the driving in Mad Max is VERY frustrating. Then there''s the leveling system. You level up Max to earn new abilities, gear, skills, etc. But then there''s some weird prophet guy that reminds me of the happy mask salesman from Majoras Mask where you can level up Max again. So it''s like you level up Max to level him up again. It''s a strange concept. And the fighting is only fun when it works. I know I wasn''t the only one because I brought it up with other people and they said they had the same problems but throughout the whole entire game the engine refuses to read your input and you will die because of unfair mechanics.

This was a very buggy game, I hear it has been fixed by the online community, although considering everything I had to go trough to play trough it back in the days, I have a bit of mixed feelings about how much you can actually fix. 

Melee fighting system is clunky and clumsy, aiming with ranged is just clumsy, which in it''s way pushes you to play the role-playing part of the game much more, rather than just strong-arming trough it.

The good:
That aside, the game is unique, in that it is one of the rare games that takes vampires a bit more seriously (I guess it''s like Twilight made by Goths). This can be attributed to its source material, the Not-C-Rpg vampire franchise of the same name, so I can''t credit the developers for it, although their execution is good.

There were no texture loading issues, lo-res sections of the map, and care and detail went into all of the environments and models. Halo takes you to different worlds throughout the galaxy and they all feel organic, refreshing, and genuine. All artifacts and landscapes have their own history, fauna, civilization, and at some points was even amazed. This game has moments where you want to stop and take in the scenery and search around the level (because if you know Halo then you know about the skulls and intel). I was truly impressed with what 343 came up with. Once again, only two complaints: One, which is pretty minor, there were sections of the game with water and when you crouch beneath it there''s no water effects, the game just becomes clear instead of murky, or blue, or whatever, but it doesn''t actually take away from the game. Two, the animations of characters in the distance end up coming off really choppy. At first I thought it was the framerate, but then realized it was how the engine handles in-game events. It looks weird and takes away from the fluidity of the game. But other than those, this game is B-E-A-UTIFUL.

SOUNDDESIGN - This is easily one of the best part of Halo. As far as sound design goes, I put it right up there with Battlefield and The Witcher. At first I had it coming through my TV speakers and it sounded fine. Nothing great, but not lacking. Then I put on my Astro headset, changed the sound option to ''headphones'', and it elevated the game to a whole new level. Each team member''s footsteps are differentiating, you can hear the individual breathing of the character''s and covenant when you get close, the list goes on. The effects are high quality, all weapons sound realistic and authentic (even the fictionalized ones), and it never blended all together as one muddy "blah" in the background when the game or cutscenes got really intense *coughcough*CallofDuty*coughcough* but actually became more immersive the louder I turned the volume up. And the soundtrack is top notch and mixed excellently with all the chaos, yelling, and explosions. The game has three-dimensional sound and you can tell who''s far off, who''s next to you, what weapons the enemy is using, everything. The main menu''s title theme holds plenty of texture and sounds are full and satisfying with a hint of nostalgia, while the battle music amps up every conflict and makes all firefights intense. This is a soundtrack I will purchase. I just wish during the quiet and ambient parts of the game there was a little more melody to give the worlds and environment just a little bit more culture, but honestly that''s just a personal preference of mine. Not one complaint in this department. Everything is absolutely perfect. 

GAMEPLAY - As far as a FPS goes, there''s not much to talk about. The story was on the shorter side, BUT there were parts that were straight pissing me off. I played through the campaign on Heroic (hard) difficulty because the game said that for Halo veterans, this difficulty is the best one. So I chose it and launched myself in. Halo puts you through the game with squad members, four in total including yourself. And it ain''t no Ghost Recon or anything, but you can "command" your squad to go places, focus on enemies, or pick you up when you fall down. But let''s take a moment to talk about this AI real quick. Something that Halo as a franchise has always put emphasis on. They utilize the "feature" horribly. Your teammates are awful companions and are ''too smart'' for their own good which ends up hurting you in the end. What I noticed 343 tried to do was to make your squad tactical, but it leads to a lot of frustration. When the team is told to focus on a certain enemy, only one will focus on said enemy and the guy even told me, and I quote, "As soon as I kill this soldier, I''ll get to him". Um, no, I''m your commander, I''m your leader, and you do as I say. If I tell you to focus on this enemy because I need some cover fire, then you put your attention on that enemy. If I need suppression so I can flank this turret, then that''s what you do. If this were real life, that would be completely understandable. But it''s not. And they put in a new feature where instead of dying, you have about 15-20 seconds for a member of your squad to make it you and pick you back up before you actually die. It''s so you can get a second chance (you can be dropped infinite times) and keep the momentum and the fight going. BUT a lot of this game was spent waiting for my team and reloading from the last checkpoint because my teammates barely ever revived me. Never mind the countless times I picked them up, they would either be a couple tens of yards away (all three of them) for whatever reason, or they would stand about four feet away from me and watch me bleed out. Just stand there and watch me die. And of course there''s no suicide option so you HAVE to wait for them to get you. And the driving, oh Lord the driving, is the worst part of their brain. I sat on the back of a mongoose for a solid half minute while my partner just chose to not drive anywhere. But it''s a good thing they didn''t because when they did drive somewhere they were too busy flipping over and running into walls "Austin Power-ing" themselves while we get shot at and blown up. This is the worst team AI in the Halo series and it was a serious step backwards. But enough about that. The actual missions themselves vary in length and hold a lot of nice variety to keep the game fresh and interesting. Halo has been an open world-esque type of shooter and it plays in nicely and is definitely a good change of pace than the usual go-here-shoot-follow-this-npc formula. The stupidest, and shortest, mission though is when you''re at a friendly camp and you have to eavesdrop on people. It was very strange and horribly executed. Other than that, Every gun has a zoom type option, when you jump and aim in mid air, the spartan actually stabilizes himself for a couple seconds so you float and can pull off a couple headshots, but the side to side sway is really slow and can''t be edited in the options menu even when the sensitivity is set to a higher amount. I''ve died from the simple fact that I couldn''t turn to shoot the enemy. I couldn''t figure out why it played like that, but it did.

MULTIPLAYER - Arguably the only reason why Halo ever got to be so popular was because of it''s competitive aspect. The company took a little bit of a different take on it and split it into two sections. Arena and Warzone. Arena is the traditional 4v4 Slayer, Swat, the classic halo multiplayer. Warzone is a big team battle where it melds a lot of what other games did. First off, the type I found the most fun was its Warzone mode where it was team against team, with AI enemies included. It consisted of a Battlefront/field type where you take control of certain command points, and at the end destroy the enemie''s home base all while killing the Prometheans and Covenant for extra points to win. I experienced very little lag (I think it was me in all honesty) and even when I lost I wanted to keep playing. At the end of each match you gain your experience, and get REQ cards. Their earned when you rank up, or when you buy them. There''s three different types of packs, Bronze, Silver, and Gold. Which can be bought with the points that are earned in every game, or with an actual credit card transaction. Within the packs are special weapons, boosts, armor upgrades, etc. What it reminded me of was Mass Effect''s special packs, Titanfalls cards, and Advanced Warfare''s feature where you earn outfit customizations and experience boosts. Overall it''s a whole separate experience from the campaign and it''s still a hell of a lot of fun.', 'Halo 5: Guardians Written Review', 3, 5, 26, str_to_date('2018-11-20 06:13:07', '%Y-%m-%d %T'), str_to_date('2018-11-20 06:13:07', '%Y-%m-%d %T'));

They wanted to go back to what Rock Band was all about. Jamming out to your favorite songs, old and new. At its roots it’s still your basic Rock Band game; notes coming down a highway and hitting them with succession. The biggest feature is the addition of freestyle solos. Instead of individual notes during a solo section, it is replaced by lines that the appear on a certain beat. Here you can press the frets anyway you want. Only thing you are required is to hit the strum bar to pace they set. 

They also revamped the option to play a set list, instead you pick the initial song and once you finish the song a list of new ones come up and you vote on the next one. Along with the option to drop in and out of songs and change difficulties on the fly, it keeps the party momentum going. The downside this is they removed the option to just pick the whole set list you would like to play from the start.

Tour mode is back but it feels more like a downgrade with the removal of the loading animations. You know, the ones where your band is shown riding a limo or doing a sound check. While you still have the choices after every section of the tour. It feels more like a “Choose your next bonus” instead of feeling like a choose your own adventure. They do however cause little quirks at the end of the tour like having to shave your hair since you contracted lice from a fan’s bird.

Certain features are not in the game at all like online multiplayer, practice mode, and a robust character creation system. Two of these are really big omissions. Harmonix did however ensured they are listening to the fans and updates are coming. This is what makes Rock Band 4 interesting. It will be the last Rock Band game to be released. Because of this they are going to continue to support RB4 with updates and new features well into the future. Sounds like they want to avoid flooding the market with plastic instruments again.

Speaking of which they got rid of Pro Guitar, and the keytar entirely. While this is a huge blow to those that invested in those instruments. According to Harmonix, they surveyed many Rock Band fans and found out many did not really care for those instruments.  Luckily for me they decided to stick with Pro Drums since the support for it has been built in since Rock Band 1. That being said, Harmonix tried to support as many legacy instruments as they could. They included every single wireless rock band instrument including RB1. They also managed to support most Guitar Hero guitars including some early ones, which is a nice bonus. With this you would be able to purchase any of the two standalone versions and continue rocking out. Madcatz did release updated instruments alongside with the game as well. You can tell they put some thought into them to make sure they would last. The pads on the drums feel like a tougher rubber. The neck on guitar feels less “plasticky.” They also included the option to update the firmware just in case some issues do arise.

The on disc songs are somewhat lackluster but some big names are here like Bruno Mars’s Uptown Funk and ever popular Panama by Van Halen. This fault is overshadowed by the fact the 1500+ legacy DLC library was updated and ported to the next gen consoles. A feat that sounded impossible, so I give Harmonix a round of applause for that. Another commendable act on their part is that you would be able to re-download every song you have purchased in older versions of Rock Band free of charge for this new game. As for those newcomers to the series, having access to such a robust song library with so many varying styles will please any fan. The price for each song did however increase to $1.99, but this is due in part adding freestyle solos to every song in the library.

Along Corrin’s quest for the truth he comes across several characters. While some are awesome and witty *coughAdamcough*, and others who are just plain dull, Miranda, there’s enough voice acting to go around.  Every single dialog in this game is fully voice but sadly it’s accompanied by stiff moving animations. If only the models moved a little better you would be able to feel the emotions of the characters. With easter eggs sprinkled here and there and an interesting plot twist, which I had to read up on it online to understand it, it makes the story somewhat enjoyable.

The world that accompanies this story is probably not the most appeasing. Every corridor in the game looks similar but in a different shade of dark. Makes you wonder if the future really is going to be all about dark colors. Most if not all levels are different combinations of big rooms or small corridors with places to cover. This is where each battle begins to get a tad repetitive. With no real variation in areas, they might as well made the entire game horde mode.  Which brings me into the controls.

The last voice controlled game I played was almost 10 years ago. So coming into this game I had high hopes that the tech has advanced far enough to make using it enjoyable. It still has its bugs here and there but it is still usable. Iridium Studios tries to alleviate the ailments by giving you the option to rename almost all of the voice commands. They give you a few default alternatives and some of them are funny like, “Party at Foxtrot 4.” But sometimes the issue is not with the commands. The game won''t outright register you if you start to get flustered when the enemies are doing some heavy damage. I ended up having to speak like a caveman to ensure I would keep calm and have the game register me. When its working the game is quite fun to control. Makes me feel like a dictator and the game characters are my peons. It would have been nice to have better keyboard and mouse controls, but in doing so would kind of ruin the story of the game.

This games soundtrack is quite enjoyable. With some awesome guitar riffs and synths, the game feels more like future you would find in an 80’s movie.  The soundtrack is composed by Big Giant Circles (Jimmy Kinson) and Ronald Jenkees. If you have listen their work before you would instantly feel at home.

You play as Vinnie Cannoli, an enforcer for a mob boss who desires a man by the name of Frankie that resides in Thugtown, considerably a hostile area. Narration provides us with a sort of semi-mystery to the plot, as the people of Thugtown are becoming zombies for some unknown reason and Vinnie only tasked with bringing back someone to his mob boss gets stuck in the teeth of the undead. 

The story presented in the game is nothing more than something to drive the gameplay. Detail and depth in this storyline are barely there, with very little interest in pushing anything meaningful, the story is never told in the gameplay and is limited to cutscene which hold not value or depth. This can be considered understandable as the game''s whole reasons for its existence is to blow up zombies in the 1920''s-era. 
The story aside, the gameplay which is the main focus of the entire game is worthy of merit. The game has you blasting away at zombies non-stop with 1920''s guns and a few other weapons that are somewhat science fiction-like but still fit in due to the non-nonsensical nature of the game. Gunplay provides satisfaction as the game provides much of the gore goodness to come out of the both genres, I never would have expected such enjoyment in using a Tommy Gun in disposing my enemies. Though there''re some downsides to the gameplay, that is that the featured variation of zombies to be found can be quiet annoying and a unfair disadvantage on the player at some moments of the game. Other enemies (rats for example) found in the game also have similar annoyance due to the size and the amount of time it takes to unload the unnecessary amount of bullet into them to be killed. Though one can consider this a little bit of a nick-pick on my part, these moments I felt were unsatisfactory. 

Graphically speaking the game has some very good looking appeal to it. The hand drawn design of the world and animations have a charm to them that can''t be replicated in 3D games. The sense of the 1920''s feel is perfectly captured. Audio also has a role to play in this game, though somewhat overlooked in areas (this would include music), the music in the game has the aesthetic appealing to that of the 1920''s though over a period of time, it becomes very much a chore to listen to it while playing the game and becomes sort of uneven with dramatic moment in the game. Other elements of the audio production though were reasonably good. The voice actor have that cliché gangster tone or the sort of New York accent, all of which were good fun hearing during game.

The weapons and materia system is easy to use and battles are easy to navigate through - which then leaves more room to develop the main game itself - of which there is at least 6o+ hours of playable time.

These effects cause problems like artefacts and uneven plane rendering. The first Tomb raider that ever played in 3D was TROAD or Tomb raider Angel of Darkness and it worked perfectly in 3D. The first ever game played by this reviewer was Half-life and that works brilliantly in 3D as does the rest of the franchise. For future reference the system being used is NVidia nVision. up until recently it was necessary to use glasses and a separate receiver but now you can purchase a monitor that is equipped with 120 Hz refresh rate and built-in 3D receiver. The advantage of the newer screen is that the entire game plays in almost perfect light. You see -  because 3D shutter glasses tend to shut the light out on every second frame your view is usually quite dark but the new system seems to have fixed that problem.
Far Cry 4 works well in 3D but not perfectly. In earlier 3D shooters your gun would actually extend out from the screen to your keyboard depending on how high you have convergence set.

Don''t expect full deep 3D vision but more of a 3D feel which is far better than standard 2D.  For those who are real keen on getting a game working well in 3D try doing a web search for Helix mod 3d. Helix releases some fabulous fixes for 3D games.
FC4 is a very immersive game with main quests, side quests, spontaneous quests and ability/skill development all the way. It is a thoroughly enjoyable game as is the rest of the franchise so get out there and get yourself some Kyrat fulfilment. My rating? 9 out of 10 rubber chickens!

The graphics, environment, and character design are absolutely jaw-dropping - I never realized i had a scare of heights until i played this game - the wind, the character using his arms to balance himself, the sound of objects dropping down below - whew, i had severe vertigo.  The various missions and voice-actors are also very impressive (and what reminds me a lot of the Metro 2033 series).

The deep intergration of parkour means that you can not get ANYWHERE without jumping, climbing, and falling your way there - this can be fun...sometimes, but to integrate it as the main form of player transportation throughout the game is gimmicky and tiresome.  Also, it is simply unrealistic that the MAJORITY of citizens (zombie and normal) would be parkour experts.  

The constant need to repair and place weapons because they "wear" out, also makes the game very tedious...i understand that this would happen with SOME weapons, but not metal bats and crowbars, c''mon!! Furthermore, the controls for various "skills" that one aquires throughout the game by earning points completing missions are so complex and similar to eachother, that i often end up performing the wrong skill, sometimes even literally throwing away one of my best weapons at an enemiy (after which it cannot be retrieved).  

The enemies were really awesome and well-designed, though i wish there had been a little bit more variety with enemy types (although there was a lot of varieties WITHIN each enemy type - which is awesome).

Finally, although the various side-missions are intricate and intersting - the overarching main story of the game is rather lackluster.

Apart from that I really liked the fact that there were whole missions that could have been resolved without wasting a single bullet, the whole role-playing thing comes in play here. I liked the thing that the game wasn''t that linear, and just like the previous series of the title but more so actually in this game past actions do influence future outcomes. 
The story and the whole game atmosphere was also very good, revealing itself as the game progressed. The China thing really strikes as an unique environment, differentiating itself from the previous two Shadowrun Retruns games. The characters were really original and non boring, might be a personal opinion, but you get attached to them the same way you would in games such as Planescape: Torment or NWN2: Mask of the Betrayer, two other games that excelled at this, in my opinion.
There are of course bad stuff: occasional bugs, where a character would appear in the matrix twice, or a quest might sometimes get bugged, though without breaking it, at least on my patched version, I''ve read stuff about missions being bugged from time to time but I never experience it. Comparing it to its predecessor Dragonfall, the game was surprisingly easy, and I was expecting a much much more hard fight for the end game. NPC dialogues also seemed a little pushed, I mean really, those people like to talk and talk and it sometimes annoying, it was better done I think in previous titles.

However, Katawa Shoujo isn''t anything like that. THANK-FUCKING-FULLY.

This game is not perfect. However, considering that is free and amateur, makes this top-notch. With beautiful scenearios, many, varied and detailed CGs and a really small but excellent soundtrack, Katawa Shoujo is a work that the people in 4leaf studios put many hours of work. And it shows.

The art and the story is really great, however, you will need to read a lot and take this game very seriously. Something hard to do, giving its premise and the amounts of text it has, compared with the little choices you can get, especially in certain routes (it could be worse though, there are visual novels with way more text), maybe.

It''s not tecnically a spoiler, but you can foreshadow easily what will happen if you read this. Read at your own risk!

The Walking Dead is a point and click adventure where you have to solve puzzles and make decisions, that Telltale claims that will affect future events of the story.

And as a story (the main point of this game), the narrative is excellent.
The characters feel real. They have some out-of-character moments, but you''ll feel pitty of the good guys and want to kill the assholes as soon as the option pops out.
It is really long, as well. For this kind of games, that is (arround 10 hours beating the main story).
The situations that will present in front of you are the point-and-click type. Click things, observe stuff, pick objects, use it to solve things. You know, since the rest of the crowd you hang with apparently are cluless. But it''s not that bad. That''s classic point-and-click stuff afterall. Good references.

This game has all the ingredients to be a masterpiece. Well, it can''t be in other way: we are talking about an indie that came out the same year as Journey and still got many attention.
I would give it a 10/10. 25/3 for the ending.

But it isn''t. And you know why?

This game LIES. It''s the biggest liar I saw in a while. More than AAAs. More than [insert not-trusty person here that you don''t like]. And I can''t pass that.

I can pass that this game has a little of "game" and more than interactive movie. I can pass that they used a franchise about shooting zombies and there isn''t any zombie shooting. In fact, I appreciate that.


But I can''t pass a game that tells me "all your decisions will affect the story" and does EVERYTHING IT CAN to ignore your decisions. No matter how decesive a decision looks: by the next episode (or sooner), you''ll see that had no relevance to the plot. And if it did, it will be nullfilled very soon.
And this dulls the game. It dulls the game, because the story you''ll read is basically the same no matter what you do. They dull the characters the game puts so much effort to build up, because they will do certain scripted things, no matter if you befriended them or treat them horrible. Sometimes they will act different... but that''s because this decision is not crucial to advance the plot. To advance it to the ending the creators had in mind. A good one, but the only one.

That''s why I had to quit it so much points. It''s not that the story or the ending is bad. They are good. But they didn''t let me decide if I liked more the other "options". Despite they told me I would.

The environment and texture artists really outdid themselves in this installment driving home an authentic feel of wherever the journey takes you. A lot of time, detail, and professionalism went into the world of Lara''s adventure and it shows. I myself have never been to Russian prisons, mass grave sites and torture chambers, or Byzantine tombs,  but if I ever do end up in one of those bizarre places I would imagine it would look exactly like this game. Even the areas that weren''t completely void of life were warm and rich with creatures and fauna. It doesn''t matter where you traverse in this universe, whether it be crawling through glaciers, sidling on cliffs in a cave, or solving ancient puzzles in hidden tombs. This world is real.

SoundDesign: I was pleasantly pleased at the audio engineering and even a little surprised. The sounds are Hi-Fi, custom and believable, and the ambiance is incredible and really elevates you to the game''s peak by its excellent job of immersion. The soundtrack holds originality and has a few memorable tracks you''ll be hoping to hear every now again. To me it wasn''t a boring blend of instruments and themes already explored and are found in standard AAA video games and movies. The actor''s performances are all incredible and I even got attached to a man that was never revealed in the game. I caught myself searching for a non existent character''s diary entries, essentially, for the simple fact that it was very progressive, and the voice actor was an incredible narrator. Which leads me into the game''s dialogue. While it doesn''t sit near the writing of The Witcher, every character has their own tone, emotions, and every interaction is unique. If the devs can hear me, keep at this level right here. You have it right.

Gameplay: Rise of the Tomb Raider takes on its new traditional formula of gameplay and added a hell of a lot to it. The game kept its fire camps to upgrade your weapons, spend skill points, and fast travel to other unlocked base camps in the game while Lara chats up little summaries and thoughts of recent events. While I upgraded and added more skills to her repertoire I couldn''t help but notice a couple things. Some of the skills are recycled from the first one (makes sense) and some skills are completely useless. Some skills do stack on top of others and add to the base skill which is nice, but there wasn''t much improved or added in this department. Just an observation. Over in the weapons section is also the same from the previous title. There''s the bow, the pickaxe, and your selection of different variants of a pistol, rifle, and shotgun giving Lara an arsenal of up to four weapons in total giving her an advantage in any situation and the developers being able to adhere to any play style. For example, if like me, you''re the type for a heavy offense, I would recommend the Compound Bow, Automatic Shotgun, Heavy Pistol, and the SMG. You''ll already have one type of each at your disposal, but it''s up to you to explore and find all the pieces you can to build said ''special'' weapons. But then this game goes deeper with its crafting system. For each weapon, there''s alternate ammo types. The arrows can be armed with a grenade, lit on fire, or sabotaged with a poison (which is my personal favorite) or maybe you want some dragonfire rounds for your shotgun? The option is there. But to get these ammo types you must loot and scrounge to find the basic items: cloth, wood, metal nuts and springs, animal pelts, and so on. This is either a highlight or the nadir of the craft system because it can get overwhelming. Your weapons and gadgets can have attachments, your skills can have skills, it''s honestly a little bit of a spider web''s mess. Everything seems intertwined, and for the first time in a very long time, I actually didn''t disable the pop-up tutorials just because this game is jam packed with all sorts of little features that aren''t utilized the entire game. Not a real problem though unlike the games controls and direction. Lara was definitely a tad clunky in certain spots. All game, she is constantly leaping platforms like Nathan Drake, climbing cliffs and mountain sides like one of Desmond''s ancestors, and killing and shooting like a madman. Woman, sorry. The environment climbing will send you plummeting into pits of doom because of wrongly registered input controls and the combat mechanics are very dry heavily relying on shallow gunplay. The reason why both of those are problems are because it leads to unnecessary checkpoint reloading, which isn''t gamebreaking because Crystal Dynamics are very forgiving with their checkpoints. No, really, the game autosaves every couple minutes and I never once dreaded reloading a checkpoint in fear of having to start over from "who knows where" so that almost makes up for it. But the gun combat, while slightly non-redundant, slightly doesn''t make sense. Example, your given the choice to upgrade any weapon of your choosing by utilizing the crafting system I briefly described earlier, and while it''s very possible to upgrade a weapon''s damage, rate of fire, and reload speed, an option is also a gun''s recoil stability. Not accuracy, recoil stability. That means no matter how many junk parts you throw into your jerry-rigged AK47, or how true your aim is in a firefight, the weapon will never shoot where it is aimed. I would''ve lost count if I tried to keep track of how many heads I missed just because the bullet would travel outside of the on-screen reticle. Those two aspects of the game were the most frustrating in my experience. Lara, seemingly intentional, jumping to her death, and a useless gun attribute. Can''t hit a single enemy at point blank because of the bullet spread, but at least the gun won''t travel upwards.', 'Rise of the Tomb Raider Written Review', 3, 4, 33, str_to_date('2018-11-20 06:13:23', '%Y-%m-%d %T'), str_to_date('2018-11-20 06:13:23', '%Y-%m-%d %T'));
